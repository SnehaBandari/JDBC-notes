Computer
============
>  It is a combination of hardware and OS.
> computer are represented as shown below


Server
========
It is a computer but the  hardware  configuration of this is
 complex compare to the desktop computer.
Eg: Server can have 22 TB of RAM

Server are represented as shown below




Operating System
=================
It acts like an interface between application and
 underlying hardware


 
 
 
 

Applications
==============
> Every Applications  has its own dedicated functionality 
eg: Adobe reader can only open pdf files
Media player can open only media files 

> Every application is platform dependent including
 java application.
 
> Java application is platform dependent however,
 java as a programming language is platform 
  independent.
  
> Java as programming language is platform independent because 
 JRE or JVM are platform dependent

There are 2 types of applications 
1. Standalone application(Unshared application)
2. Web application(Shared Applications)


Standalone Applications
=====================
Standalone applications are present in our 
own computer and they are dedicated per user.
Eg: Adobe reader, Web browser, Media player etc...


There are 2 types of Standalone applications 
1. Desktop Application
	As the name implies it is present in our own computer

2. Mobile Application
	As the name implies it is present in smart phones
	
	
	
	
Web Applications
===================
Web applications are not present in our own computer,
 but they are present in some other computer,
 where our computer and that computer is network
 connected.
Eg: GMail, Facebook, Twitter etc...
		
To interact with web application we must make use of 
1. Network 
2.Web Browser

 Network
 ===================
	It is a collection of computers and there are
	two types of network
	
	1. Intranet(Private network)
	 eg: JSpiders attendance tracking web application
	 is present in intranet network.
	
	2. Internet(Public network)
		eg: Gmail app is present in internet
	
	
Web Browser
================
Web browser is a desktop application and if we are
 using browser means we are interacting with
 web application.
 

	
	
	







RDBMS Application
===================
It is also an application which helps us to store and
 maintain GBs to TBs of data
RDBMS application is represented as shown below














J2EE(Java 2 Enterprise Edition)
===============================
>J2EE is a collection of APIs (Application Programming Interface),
 which helps us to develop "Enterprise Web Application".

API(Application Programming Interface)
===================================
>An API is a collection of packages with dedicated functionality


Major API of J2EE are
=======================
1. JDBC
2.Servlet
3.JSP
4.Java Mail
etc...

>JDBC API helps web application to interact with
 RDBMS Application.
>Servlet and JSP APIs helps web application to 
	-Get the request from browser
	-Generate the response
	-Gives it back to the browser
>"J2EE" helps to develop "Web Application"
 where as "Android / IOS" helps
 to develop "Mobile Apps".

 
 
 
>Mobile Applications are 2 tier Architectured Applications
>However web application acts like 3 tier architectured application if it is 
accessed using web browser.

> 2 tier architectured application if it is accessed using mobile app
> 3 tier architectured applications are easy to maintain as compared to 
	2 tier architectured applications.
