Servlet Introduction
=================================


Web Browswer
===============================
> It is a desktop application which helps us to interact with web applications
> Browser is the one and only application which understand content/data present in html and display accordingly.

Web Resources
===============================
>Resources present inside web application are called as web resources.

There are two types of web resources
========================================
1. Static web resources
===========================

>These resources "are present at web application" before making the request.
>Content of those resources "does not change " for every request(Static response)
>In otherwords, resources which generates "static response" is called as static web resources.

-few examples,
1. Any songs/video/movie files download
2. Any softwares download
3. Any books(pdf, ms word, etc...) download

2.Dynamic Web resources
===============================
>These resources "does not present at web application" before making the request and they get generated at the time of request.
> In otherwords resources which generates dynamic response, is called Dynamic web resources.
>content of the resources "may change" for every requesst(Dynamic response).

-few examples
1.Any net Banking web application transaction staatement download(pdf).
2.Any post paid connection statement download (pdf).
3. Google search page.
4. Gmail Inbox page.
5. Facebook homepage.
6.Gmail "Download all attachments"(zip file).

Note:
==========
>both static and Dynamic response can be html or non html in nature.


Web application
=====================
> web application is an application which is accessed over the network with the help of browser.
> web application is a collection of web resources.
> If a web application contains only static web resources then it is called as an staatic web application.
> if a web application contains one/more dynamic web resources then it is called as an dynamic web application.
	eg: gmail, facebook, twitter, flipkart, etc...
> J2EE/ Java EE helps us to develop dynamic web application.
> however html helps us to develop static web application.

WebServer 
============================
> Like any other application(Adobe Reader, media player etc..) webserver is also an application which runs an os.
> Web server as the name implies "Server requests to a web application".
>In otherwords, it helps both web browser and web application to interact with each other.
> Hence every web application(Static/Dynamic) is directly under the control of web server.

few examples of webserver
==============================
1. Apache Tomcat
2. Redhat JBoss
3. IBM websphere
4. Oracle weblogic
5. Oracle glassfish

Steps to install apache tomcat webserver 
====================================
Download the apache tomcat(zip version) and extract it onto some directory.

Set the following 2 environment variables
1. JAVA_HOME
2. CATALINA_HOME

for eg:
		JAVA_HOME : c:\programfiles\java\jdk1.8.0.27
		CATALINA_HOME: c:\programfiles\apache-tomcat-8.0.5
		
Note:
=========
> Both paths should not point to "lib/bin" folder
> JAVA_HOME should consists of "java installation " path not the "java exe" location path.

Go to "<Tomcat-location>\bin" folder and double  click on startup.bat or startup file.

>After this step, server should start without throwing an exception in the console.
>If server throws an exception then it menas that server started in exception mode.
> in this case, most likely there is a problem in setting up the environment variable.
> To shut down the webserver close the console window or use "ctrl  + c"
